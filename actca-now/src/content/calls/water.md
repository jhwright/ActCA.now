title: "Water Sovereignty"
officialName: "E. Joaquin Esquivel"
officialTitle: "Chair, State Water Resources Control Board"
phone: "9163415250"
script: "I'm calling to urge Chair Esquivel to prioritize California's water sovereignty and security. As a voter in zip code [ZIP], I believe our state must have full authority over its own water resources, allocation, and conservation programs. Please support the implementation of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) and measures like SB 1227 that ensure our agricultural and urban water needs are met on our own terms. California's water future should be decided by Californians, not by federal bureaucracies that may not prioritize our state's unique needs. Thank you."
priority: false
rationale: "Water is the lifeblood of California's environment and economy, and securing state-led control over this vital resource is essential for our future. By asserting water sovereignty, California can prioritize its own agricultural needs—which feed much of the nation—and ensure urban water security through state-specific conservation and infrastructure projects. Strengthening our autonomy means effectively managing groundwater under SGMA and investing in innovative solutions like desalination and recycling without federal interference. The State Water Resources Control Board's role in managing water quality and rights is critical for ensuring that California remains resilient in the face of climate-driven droughts and competing demands."
