script: "I'm calling to demand you support the California Water Sovereignty Act, Assembly Bill 7890. I am a California voter in zip code [ZIP]. We need state-controlled water management that prioritizes California's needs over federal allocation policies. Support AB 7890 to give California full authority over water rights, distribution, and conservation programs. Our agricultural and urban water needs cannot depend on federal decisions that historically disadvantage California. Vote yes on water sovereignty now. Thank you."
priority: false
rationale: "Water is California's most critical resource, essential for agriculture, urban communities, and environmental protection. State sovereignty over water management ensures that California's unique needs and conservation priorities take precedence over federal allocation systems that have historically shortchanged our state."
