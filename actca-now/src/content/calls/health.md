script: "I'm calling to demand you support the California Healthcare Independence Act, Senate Bill 3456. I am a California voter in zip code [ZIP]. We need state-controlled healthcare funding to expand Medi-Cal, fund community health centers, and guarantee coverage for all Californians regardless of federal policy changes. Support legislation that establishes California's healthcare independence now. Vote yes on SB 3456. Our residents' health cannot wait for federal political shifts. Thank you."
priority: false
rationale: "Healthcare is a fundamental right that should not depend on federal political cycles. State-controlled healthcare funding ensures continuity of care, allows California to expand coverage beyond federal minimums, and protects vulnerable populations from policy changes in Washington that could leave millions without access to medical services."
