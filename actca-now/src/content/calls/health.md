officialTitle: "Director, California Department of Health Care Services"
phone: "9164407400"
script: "I'm calling to urge Director Baass to champion the California Guaranteed Health Care for All Act (AB 2200). As a voter in zip code [ZIP], I believe healthcare is a human right and that California must lead the way in establishing a state-run single-payer system. Please support the transition to CalCare to ensure that all 40 million Californians have access to comprehensive, affordable coverage independent of federal policy changes. Our state has the capacity and the vision to provide universal healthcare that prioritizes people over profits. Thank you."
priority: false
rationale: "The California Guaranteed Health Care for All Act (AB 2200) represents a bold step toward healthcare sovereignty for our state. By establishing CalCare, a state-controlled single-payer system, California can ensure universal coverage with zero copays and deductibles, while protecting access to essential services like reproductive healthcare and mental health support. This transition builds on the strength of our Medi-Cal program and leverages California's economic power to negotiate lower costs and improve health outcomes for all residents. Implementing a state-controlled healthcare system ensures that California remains a sanctuary for health and well-being, independent of federal policy shifts or funding constraints."
