script: "I'm calling to demand you support state-controlled housing policy through the California Housing Autonomy Act. I am a California voter in zip code [ZIP]. We need Assembly Bill 9012 passed to give California full control over affordable housing funding, rent stabilization, and development regulations without federal restrictions. Our housing crisis requires immediate action. Support state autonomy in housing policy now. Vote yes on AB 9012. Thank you."
priority: false
rationale: "California faces an acute housing shortage affecting millions of residents. State-controlled housing policy allows us to implement solutions tailored to our specific needs, from affordable housing development to tenant protections, without federal constraints that often slow or prevent effective action."
