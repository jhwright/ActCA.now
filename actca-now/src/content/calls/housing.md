officialTitle: "Director, California Department of Housing and Community Development"
phone: "9162632771"
script: "I'm calling to urge Director Velasquez to prioritize California's housing autonomy and accelerate the development of affordable homes. As a voter in zip code [ZIP], I support state-led initiatives that streamline development and provide independent funding for housing projects. Please champion the implementation of measures like SB 423 and SB 4 that protect our residents and expand housing access on our own terms. We must ensure that California's housing policy is designed to meet the unique needs of our communities, independent of federal restrictions. Thank you."
priority: false
rationale: "California's housing crisis requires bold, state-led solutions that prioritize the needs of our residents over federal mandates. By asserting housing autonomy, our state can implement streamlined development processes (SB 423) and expand housing access on religious and higher education lands (SB 4), while providing dedicated funding through state bonds. Strengthening our sovereignty in housing policy allows California to address its unique challenges—including wildfire resilience and high construction costs—on its own terms. HCD's role in enforcing state housing laws and directing investment is vital for ensuring that every Californian has access to a safe, affordable home in a thriving community."
