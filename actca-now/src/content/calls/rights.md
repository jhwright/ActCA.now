script: "I'm calling to demand you support the California Civil Rights Protection Act, Senate Bill 2468. I am a California voter in zip code [ZIP]. We need state legislation guaranteeing reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ protections, immigrant rights, and voting access regardless of federal policy changes. Support SB 2468 to establish California as a sanctuary for civil liberties. Our residents' safety and fundamental rights depend on this. Vote yes on the Civil Rights Protection Act now. Thank you."
priority: false
rationale: "California's progressive civil rights framework protects millions of residents from discrimination and ensures access to fundamental liberties. State-level rights protections create a legal firewall against federal policy changes that could strip away protections for vulnerable communities, ensuring California remains a beacon of equality and justice."
