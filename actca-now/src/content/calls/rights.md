title: "Rights - Fight I.C.E."
officialName: "Kevin Kish"
officialTitle: "Director, California Civil Rights Department"
phone: "9164787251"
script: "I'm calling to urge Director Kish to strengthen California's position as a sanctuary for civil liberties and fundamental rights. As a voter in zip code [ZIP], I believe our state must lead the defense of reproductive freedom, LGBTQ+ equality, and voting access. Please champion the implementation of state-controlled protections that remain independent of federal shifts. We must ensure that every Californian is protected under our own robust legal framework. I support measures like SB 1174 that safeguard our democracy and protect our diverse communities from outside interference. Thank you."
priority: false
rationale: "California's Civil Rights Department (formerly DFEH) is the first line of defense in protecting the rights and dignity of all Californians. As federal protections for reproductive rights and voting access are challenged, California must assert its sovereignty to codify and enforce its own higher standards. Strengthening state-level protections ensures that fundamental rights like marriage equality, bodily autonomy, and equal opportunity remain ironclad in California. By leading with a comprehensive civil rights framework, our state demonstrates that we can protect our residents independently, serving as a model for liberty and equality in 2025 and beyond."
