title: "Energy Independence"
officialName: "David Hochschild"
officialTitle: "Chair, California Energy Commission"
phone: "9166544989"
script: "I'm calling to urge Chair Hochschild to prioritize California's energy independence and grid resilience. As a voter in zip code [ZIP], I believe we must accelerate our transition to 100% renewable energy and expand our state-controlled battery storage capacity. Please support measures that strengthen our energy sovereignty, including microgrid requirements for wildfire resilience and incentives for green manufacturing. California must control its own energy destiny to ensure reliable and affordable power for all residents. Thank you."
priority: false
rationale: "California's transition to a clean energy future is a matter of both environmental and economic security. By asserting energy sovereignty, our state can accelerate the implementation of SB 100 (100% clean energy by 2045) and invest in a modern, resilient grid independent of federal energy policy shifts. Expanding state-controlled energy infrastructure, including solar, wind, and battery storage, ensures that California remains a global leader in innovation while creating thousands of high-quality green jobs. The California Energy Commission's role in setting building standards and directing infrastructure investment is critical for building a future where our energy supply is clean, reliable, and entirely under state control."
