script: "I'm calling to urge CEO Choudri to prioritize independent state-controlled funding for the High-Speed Rail project. As a voter in zip code [ZIP], I believe California must lead the way in modern transportation by completing the Merced-Bakersfield segment and expanding to San Francisco and Los Angeles on our own terms. We cannot wait for unpredictable federal funding. Please support measures that authorize dedicated state bonds and revenue to ensure this critical infrastructure connects our cities and reduces emissions for generations to come. Thank you."
priority: false
rationale: "The California High-Speed Rail project is the most ambitious infrastructure project in our state's history. With Ian Choudri as CEO, the Authority has the opportunity to assert California's independence by securing stable, state-led funding. Traffic congestion costs Californians billions in lost productivity, while carbon emissions continue to impact our climate. By prioritizing the 'California-First' approach, we can complete this project without the delays and strings attached to federal grants. This creates 100,000+ jobs and demonstrates that California has the economic power and vision to build world-class infrastructure independently, reinforcing our position as a global leader in transportation and environmental responsibility."
