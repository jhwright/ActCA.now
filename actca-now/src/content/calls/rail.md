script: "I'm calling to demand you support California-First funding for High Speed Rail with no federal strings attached. I am a California voter in zip code [ZIP]. We need Assembly Bill 1234 and Senate Bill 5678 passed immediately to authorize state-controlled HSR funding. California has the resources to complete this project independently. Stop waiting for federal approval and move forward with full state funding now. This infrastructure is critical for connecting our cities and reducing emissions. Vote yes on California-First HSR funding. Thank you."
priority: false
rationale: "High Speed Rail is critical infrastructure that will connect California's major cities and reduce carbon emissions. By asserting state control over funding and implementation, we ensure the project serves Californians first without federal interference or delays. This demonstrates California's capacity for independent infrastructure development."
