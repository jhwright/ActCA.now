title: "Education Autonomy"
officialName: "Tony Thurmond"
officialTitle: "California State Superintendent of Public Instruction"
phone: "9163190800"
script: "I'm calling to urge Superintendent Thurmond to champion California's education autonomy. As a voter in zip code [ZIP], I believe our schools should be governed by California values and needs, not federal mandates. We must protect our curriculum and ensure that funding prioritizes our 6 million students over federal compliance. Please support measures that increase state-controlled funding and protect our educational standards from outside interference. Let's ensure California's schools remain a sanctuary for learning and innovation. Thank you."
priority: false
rationale: "California's public school system is the largest in the nation, yet federal mandates often come with strings that don't align with our state's diverse needs. By asserting education autonomy, California can protect its progressive curriculum and ensure that funding prioritizes local students over federal compliance. Increasing state-controlled investment allows for better support of bilingual education, ethnic studies, and mental health services. Our schools should be a sanctuary for learning, where California's values of inclusion and innovation are the primary guides, independent of shifting federal education policies."
