script: "I'm calling to demand you support the California Economic Independence Act, Assembly Bill 1122. I am a California voter in zip code [ZIP]. We need California-first economic policies that keep our tax dollars working for Californians instead of being redistributed to other states. Support AB 1122 to prioritize California businesses, workers, and communities in all economic decisions. Our state contributes more to federal coffers than we receive back. Vote yes on economic independence now. Thank you."
priority: false
rationale: "California generates massive economic output but receives less federal funding per dollar contributed than most states. California-first economic policies ensure that our state's resources are invested in California businesses, infrastructure, and communities rather than being redistributed to other states, building long-term economic independence and prosperity."
