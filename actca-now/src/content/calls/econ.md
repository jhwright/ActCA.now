script: "I'm calling to urge Director Myers to prioritize the California Economic Independence initiative. As a voter in zip code [ZIP], I believe our tax dollars should stay in California to support our own businesses, workers, and infrastructure. We must reduce our reliance on federal redistribution and prioritize in-state procurement for state contracts. Please support the expansion of the California Infrastructure Bank and other measures that keep our capital working for Californians. Our state's economic strength should serve the needs of our own communities first. Thank you."
priority: false
rationale: "California's economy is the 5th largest in the world, yet we often receive less back in federal spending than we contribute in taxes. By prioritizing the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank (IBank) and state-controlled economic funds, we can ensure our wealth stays within our borders to benefit our communities. Economic independence means prioritizing California-based businesses for state contracts and investing in our own innovation hubs. GO-Biz is uniquely positioned to lead this 'California First' economic strategy, reducing our vulnerability to federal economic shifts and ensuring that the prosperity generated in California serves the needs of all Californians first."
