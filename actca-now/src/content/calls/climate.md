topic: "climate"
officialName: "Liane Randolph"
officialTitle: "Chair, California Air Resources Board"
phone: "9163222990"
script: "I'm calling to urge Chair Randolph to aggressively implement California's independent climate standards and defend our state's climate sovereignty. As a voter in zip code [ZIP], I support the implementation of the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (SB 253) and other measures that exceed federal requirements. We must ensure that California's transition to 100% renewable energy and zero-emission vehicles remains on track, regardless of federal policy shifts. Our climate future depends on California's continued leadership and autonomy. Thank you."
priority: false
rationale: "California's climate leadership is essential for protecting our environment and economy. By implementing Senate Bills 253 and 254, California asserts its authority to require corporate transparency on emissions and financial risks, setting a global standard independent of federal policy shifts. Our state's cap-and-trade program and 100% renewable energy mandate (SB 100) demonstrate that we can reduce emissions while growing the world's 5th largest economy. Strengthening California's climate sovereignty ensures that our progress on zero-emission vehicles and carbon neutrality remains resilient against federal inaction or reversals. CARB's role is critical in maintaining this independence and ensuring California remains a global beacon for climate action."
